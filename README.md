# Roulette
A program to simulate a game of roulette. In roulette, a wheel spins and yields a number between 1 and 36 when a ball drops into a numbered slot. There are also slots numbered 0 and 00. These slots are green and each of the other slots is red or black. Additionally, 0 and 00 are not considered either even or odd, nor high or low.
In Las Vegas style rules, gamblers can make several different kinds of bets, each of which pays off differently as listed in the table below. These payoffs are close to the real mathematical odds of getting such a spin, but slightly lower to allow the casino to make a profit on average. The types of bets implemented and payoffs include red/black 1 to 1, odd/even 1 to 1, high/low 1 to 1, single number 35 to 1, two consecutive numbers 17 to 1, and three consecutive numbers 11 to 1.
